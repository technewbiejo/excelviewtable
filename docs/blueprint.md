## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#5DADE2) to create a sense of clarity and reliability, in keeping with a data app.
- Background color: A light blue-gray (#D4E6F1), a desaturated variant of the primary, will offer a muted, clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#A569BD) to highlight interactive elements such as the search bar, filter buttons and column headers. 
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' for headlines and 'Inter' for body text; sans-serif fonts for modern look and legibility.
- Use simple, clear icons from a set like Material Icons to represent filtering and sorting options.
- Modern, clean layout with good spacing for readability; the table should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- Subtle transitions and animations on table updates, search results, and filter applications to provide a smooth user experience.
